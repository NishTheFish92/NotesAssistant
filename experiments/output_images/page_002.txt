Here's a description of the image:

The image is a slide from a presentation, likely about computer architecture or systems. The slide's title is "Introduction to I/O Module" in a large, green font. Below the title, there are several bullet points explaining the concept of I/O modules:

*   The first bullet point defines I/O as Input-Output of a computer.
*   The second bullet point states that I/O devices are connected to the CPU through an I/O module, which is referred to as Interfacing. The terms "I/O module" and "Interfacing" are highlighted in red.
*   The third bullet point asks "What for I/O?" and explains that the I/O module provides an efficient mode of communication between the CPU and the external environment.
*   The fourth bullet point asks "Why to use I/O module? Why can't connect peripheral devices directly to the subsystem?" and lists the reasons as:
    *   Diversity
    *   Speed
    *   Control

The background of the slide is white. The text is primarily black, with the title in green and certain keywords in red. The questions "What for I/O?" and "Why to use I/O module?" are in blue.
