The image is a slide or document page, likely from a course on computer architecture and organization. At the top, in green text, is "BCSE205L" followed by "Computer Architecture and Organization". Below that, in a reddish-brown color, is "Module 5 â€“ Interfacing and Communication".

A table is present, outlining the contents of Module 5. The table has three columns: "Module:5", "Interfacing and Communication", and "5 Hours". The content listed under "Interfacing and Communication" includes I/O fundamentals (handshaking, buffering, I/O Modules), I/O techniques (Programmed I/O, Interrupt-driven I/O, Direct Memory Access, Direct Cache Access), Interrupt structures (Vectored and Prioritized-interrupt overhead), Buses (Synchronous and asynchronous), and Arbitration.

At the bottom of the image, in blue text, is "Dr. C.R.Dhivyaa", followed by "Assistant Professor", "School of Computer Science and Engineering", and "Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore".
