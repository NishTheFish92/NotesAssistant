The image is a diagram illustrating CPU and I/O module organization. It shows a CPU connected to an I/O module via address, data, and control buses. The I/O module contains an interface, a controller, and devices. Below this diagram is a more detailed block diagram of a Systems Bus Interface and an External Device Interface. The Systems Bus Interface includes a Data Register, a Status/Control Register, and Input/Output Logic. The External Device Interface includes External Device Interface Logic blocks. The diagram also includes text highlighting key characteristics of the system, such as the presence of many I/O devices, each with a unique address, and the sharing of a common bus by the processor, main memory, and I/O.
