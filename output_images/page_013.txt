The image is a slide explaining asynchronous data transfer methods, specifically destination-initiated transfer using handshaking. The title of the slide is "Asynchronous Data Transfer Methods" in green. The section being described is labeled "iv) Destination Initiated Transfer Using Handshaking" in blue.

The slide describes the process in a series of bullet points. First, it states that the destination initiates the data transfer. Then, it explains that the "READY/REQUEST FOR DATA" signal is turned ON, indicating a request for data on the data bus. Next, it explains that the "DATA VALID" signal, when ON, indicates that the data on the bus is valid. The slide then breaks down the process into four steps: (i) the destination activates the "Ready for Data" signal when it's ready to receive data; (ii) the source responds by putting data on the data bus and enabling the "Data valid" signal; (iii) the destination accepts the data and disables the "Request/Ready for Data" signal; and (iv) the "Data valid" signal is disabled, indicating that the data on the bus is no longer valid. The slide concludes by stating that this process ensures the source has successfully placed the data on the bus.

Three diagrams are included to illustrate the process. Diagram (a) is a block diagram showing a "Source Unit" connected to a "Destination Unit" via a "Data Bus," "Data Valid" line, and "Ready for data" line. Diagram (b) is a timing diagram showing the relationship between the "Ready for data," "Data valid," and "Data bus" signals over time. Diagram (c) is a sequence diagram showing the sequence of events in the source and destination units, including placing data on the bus, enabling/disabling the data valid signal, and accepting data from the bus.
