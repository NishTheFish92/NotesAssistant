The slide lists problems faced in strobe-based asynchronous data transfer. The main heading is in red. The first bullet point is "No Acknowledgement for Data Sent/Received," written in purple.

The next two bullet points describe issues with source-initiated and destination-initiated strobes, noting that there is no surety that the data has been read or put on the data bus, respectively.

The final bullet point, written in green, states that "This problem is overcome by Handshaking."
