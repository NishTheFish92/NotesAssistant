The image is a slide presentation with a white background. The title "Introduction to I/O Module" is at the top, written in a dark green color. Below the title, there are several bullet points. The first bullet point states "I/O is referred as Input-Output of a computer." The second bullet point says "I/O devices are connected to CPU through I/O module called as Interfacing," with "I/O module" and "Interfacing" highlighted in red. The third bullet point is a question: "What for I/O?" followed by a sub-bullet point stating "I/O module provides an efficient mode of communication between CPU and outside of environment." The fourth bullet point is another question: "Why to use I/O module? Why can't connect peripheral devices directly to the subsystem?" followed by three sub-bullet points: "Diversity," "Speed," and "Control." The bullet points are in black, except for the questions, which are in blue.
