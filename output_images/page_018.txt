The image is a slide about "Types of Buffering," specifically focusing on "Double buffering." The title "Types of Buffering" is in large, dark green font. Below the title, there's a bulleted list explaining double buffering. The points include that two buffers are used instead of one, a producer fills one buffer while a consumer uses another simultaneously, the producer doesn't have to wait for the buffer to fill, and double buffering is also known as buffer swapping.

Below the text, there's a diagram illustrating double I/O buffering. The diagram shows an "Operating System" block containing "Buffer 1" and "Buffer 2." An arrow labeled "IN" points from "I/O DEVICE" to the operating system block. Another arrow labeled "MOVE" points from the operating system block to a "User Process" block containing "Consumer." The diagram is labeled "DOUBLE I/O BUFFERING" below.
