The image is a slide presentation about "Types of Buffering," specifically focusing on "Circular buffering." The title "Types of Buffering" is in green. The "Circular buffering" title is in blue.

Below the title, there are bullet points describing circular buffering. The bullet points are: "More than two buffers are used, the buffers' collection is called a circular buffer.", "Each buffer is being one unit in the circular buffer.", "Increases data transfer rate than the double buffering.", "Data do not directly pass from the producer to the consumer because the data would change due to overwriting of buffers before consumed.", and "The producer can only fill up to buffer x-1 while data in buffer x is waiting to be consumed." The text in the bullet points is black, except for some words which are red.

Below the bullet points, there is a diagram illustrating circular I/O buffering. The diagram shows an "I/O DEVICE" connected to an "OPERATING SYSTEM" which contains "Buffer 1", "Buffer 2", and "Buffer n". The buffers are arranged vertically. Arrows indicate data flow from the I/O device into the buffers and from the buffers to a "Consumer" within a "USER PROCESS". The word "MOVE" is written on the arrow between the operating system and the user process. The word "IN" is written on the arrow between the I/O device and the operating system. The text "CIRCULAR I/O BUFFERING" is written below the diagram.
